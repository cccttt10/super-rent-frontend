# Instructions for local development

Follow the instructions below if you want to get the project running on your local machine.


## Configure your environment

1. Follow the [backend configuration instructions](https://github.com/chuntonggao/super-rent-backend/blob/master/README.md) to start the server in development mode. Make sure the server is started BEFORE you start the front end. Otherwise the front end cannot receive any data.

2. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

3. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/chuntonggao/super-rent-frontend.git`

1. `yarn install` to download the project's dependencies
