## Configure your environment

1. Follow the [backend configuration instructions](https://github.com/chuntonggao/super-rent-backend/blob/master/README.md) and start the server.

2. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

3. Clone your repository by running `git clone REPO_URL` on the command line. You get the `REPO_URL` by clicking on the green button on the GitHub repository page.

## Development mode

Once your environment is configured you need to further prepare the project's tooling and dependencies. In the project directory:

1. `yarn install` to download the project's dependencies.

2. `yarn start` to start the front-end application.

3. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.
